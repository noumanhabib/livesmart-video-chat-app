Overview
LiveSmart Google Chrome Assistant is a Chrome extension that is helping your agents to contact their visitors and is removing the necessity of being logged in the Dashboard panel.

Installation
There are two ways of installing the Assistant for your agents. Before going to any of the installation procedures, open the manifest file extensions/assistant/chrome/manifest.json and change https://dokunotary.ga https://dokunotary.ga:9001/ with your LiveSmart site location and LiveSmart server endpoint. The endpoint can be seen in config/config.json file in your main folder. For example if your LiveSmart is located here https://mydomain.com/video and your endpoint is https://mydomain.com:9001, your need to change the manifest like this
"content_security_policy": "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' https://mydomain.com https://mydomain.com:9001/; object-src 'self'",
